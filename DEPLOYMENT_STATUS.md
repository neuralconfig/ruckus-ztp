# RUCKUS ZTP Edge Agent Deployment Status

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Edge Agent Architecture ✅
- **Complete migration**: `ssh_proxy/` → `ztp_edge_agent/` with enhanced functionality
- **Local ZTP execution**: Full ZTP process runs on edge agents
- **Event-driven communication**: Real-time events streamed to cloud dashboard
- **Multi-agent support**: Single dashboard manages multiple edge deployments
- **Local resilience**: Operations continue during cloud disconnection

### 2. Cloud Dashboard Deployment ✅
- **Production URL**: https://ruckusztp.neuralconfig.com
- **Google Cloud Run**: Free tier configuration with SSL certificates
- **New Dashboard UI**: Modern interface with Dashboard, Edge Agents, and Events tabs
- **Multi-agent management**: Centralized monitoring and configuration
- **Real-time events**: WebSocket streaming from multiple edge agents

### 3. Edge Agent Components ✅
- **ZTP Manager**: `ztp_manager.py` for local ZTP process execution
- **WebSocket Client**: Persistent connection with automatic reconnection
- **Event Publisher**: Real-time event streaming to dashboard
- **Configuration Management**: Dynamic configuration updates from dashboard
- **Service Integration**: Complete systemd service with installation script

### 4. UI/UX Improvements ✅
- **Configuration Progress Indicators**: Visual progress circles for switch and AP configuration phases
  - Switches: 2 circles (base config + device config)
  - APs: 1 circle (port configuration)
  - Color coding: Grey (pending) → Green (completed)
- **Device Model Display**: Accurate model extraction and display for APs (e.g., "R350", "R750")
- **Topology Visualization**: Proper switch port display for AP connections
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Live progress updates during configuration
- **Data Flow Optimization**: Complete inventory field mapping across all system layers

## Current Status

### Production Deployment Ready ✅
- **Dashboard**: https://ruckusztp.neuralconfig.com (fully operational)
- **SSL Certificates**: Provisioned and working
- **Edge Agent Support**: Ready for multiple agent deployments
- **Event Processing**: Real-time event handling and storage
- **Rate Limiting**: 30 requests/minute per agent protection

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Edge Agent Installation
On any network-connected device (Ubuntu/Debian recommended):

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ruckus-ztp

# Install edge agent
cd ztp_edge_agent
sudo ./install.sh

# Service will start automatically and connect to dashboard
sudo systemctl status ruckus-ztp-edge-agent
```

### 2. Monitor Edge Agent Registration
```bash
# Check dashboard API for connected agents
curl https://ruckusztp.neuralconfig.com/api/edge-agents

# View edge agent logs
sudo journalctl -u ruckus-ztp-edge-agent -f
```

### 3. Configure Through Dashboard
1. Access https://ruckusztp.neuralconfig.com
2. Go to **Edge Agents** tab to verify agent connection
3. Configure seed switches and network settings in **Configuration** tab
4. Monitor real-time events in **Events** tab
5. View overall statistics in **Dashboard** tab

### 4. Local Development (Optional)
To run dashboard locally for development:
```bash
cd web_app
python run.py
# Access at http://localhost:8000
```

### Key Architecture Benefits:
- **Cost Efficient**: Local ZTP execution reduces cloud compute and data transfer costs
- **Resilient**: ZTP continues during cloud connectivity issues
- **Scalable**: Multiple edge agents can be managed from single dashboard
- **Real-time**: Event-driven communication provides immediate visibility
- **Secure**: Local network access with encrypted cloud communication

## Technical Notes

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Run free tier (256Mi RAM, 1 CPU, scales to zero)
- **Dashboard Service**: Single Cloud Run service serves both dashboard UI and API
- **Edge Connectivity**: Outbound WebSocket connections (no inbound firewall rules needed)
- **Cost Optimization**: Architecture designed to minimize cloud costs and stay within free tier
